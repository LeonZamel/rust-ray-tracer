# Rust ray tracer
This is an educational project to learn the Rust programming language and ray tracing fundamentals.
Based on [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
Extensions to the book:
    - Shadows
    - Support for multiple light sources
    - Triengles and Meshes (WIP)

Note that not all formulas for calculating brightness, reflection, etc. are necessarily "correct" or standard practice. They are a mixture of what is efficient (enough), looks good, and seemed plausible.
