# Rust ray tracer
Based on [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

Not all formulas for calculating brightness, reflection, etc. are "correct" or standard practice. But they are efficient (enough) and look correct, which is the main focus.

Extensions to the book:
    - Shadows
    - Support for multiple light sources
